FILL DATABASE WITH 2 TEAM'S WORTH OF RANK DATA: <
	

WRITE SEEDING ALGO:
	CREATE CLASS TEAMSKILLDTO FOR TRANSFERRING SKILL DATA <
	takes as an argument: REGION (of the tournament) <
		could be a method of Tournament??? x
		WRITE AN ALGO CALCULATES A TEAM'S SKILL SCORE BASED ON THEIR MEMBERS AND RETURNS A MAP OBJECT OF TeamSkillDto (team with an extra field) <
	PUT IT INTO A LIST<TeamSkillDto> <
	Write an algo that orders that list based on the skill level <
	it returns that list<
	make updating ranks thru riot api optional
	write algo that takes only tournament and seeds it <

	CREATE REST CONTROLLER FOR SEEDING <
	

WRITE RIOT API STUFF:
	update DB tournament field with "currently_updating" boolean that the rank updating method will set and unset to make sure that we keep consistency

	research how to make many fast async http calls
		likely will need spring @Async and make it update a tournament's DB part with a "currently being updated" boolean to true to avoid tournaments starting while its being updated
	research all lol ranks: <
		make an enum to represent them, avoid magic constants <
	write a method that updates the relevant RegionalAccounts of the DBase for a tournament with ranks:
		make it do a limited number of api calls/10seconds to avoid being blocked for ddos
			research how many calls i can make before being blocked for ddos
	write a simple crontab to update the api key every 12 hours and have it run on the RBerry Pi

CONSIDER ADDING IMAGES:
	!!!!REVERSE PROXIY STUFF???!!!!!
	GET 16 (maybe 24) FREE PG IMAGES THAT TEAMS CAN USE TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES
	HOST THEM ON SOME FREE SITE
	GIVE THE DB A NEW TABLE "image" THAT CONTAINS: image_id and image_url
	extra fields to "team" table: image_id
